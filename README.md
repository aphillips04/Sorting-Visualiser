# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 

This project is a visual representation of various sorting algorithms such as [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort), [quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), [heap sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort), [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort), [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort), [shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort), and [TimSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort). The visualizer allows you to see how each algorithm works and understand the differences in performance.
